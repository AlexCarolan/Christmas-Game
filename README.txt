You should find some example code, an image file, and a Java archive
in a directory called Test.

You can compile and run the example with the commands:

	javac -cp jsfml.jar;. Test.java
	java  -cp jsfml.jar;. Test

Note that the code uses recent Java additions and so needs Java 8.

If running this on your own machine you will need to install SFML
from http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

Depending which version of SFML you install you might also need to
the matching Visual C++ (2010, ...) Redistributable Package,
available from Microsoft.
